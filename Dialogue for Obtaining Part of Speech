I need a POS.

I heard X. Is this correct?

I didn't get that one. I need a POS.

I heard X, Y, ... and Z. Would you like X, Y, ... or Z?

OK. I got X. I need a POS.

OK. I got X. We're done.

Some ideas for interaction to try

Use the dialog model
Create an intent for POS with ONE slot of type AMAZON.SearchQuery to be fulfilled

// First task
begin interaction with 'Alexa, let's play mad lib'
assume a template is chosen at random which would require x verbs, n adjectives, etc.
send a pos intent back as the response with a 'SearchQuery' slot
confirm the value for that slot and repeat - we can fake the validation for now

So first development step is to create a pos intent AND successfully manage that
as an initial step - just get things working for verb pos

// states
posselectmode  - alexa is eliciting a response to fill the pos slot
    possible responses:
        the pos - in this case, validate and either confirm or reject and try again
        not understood - try again

posconfirmmode - alexa is eliciting a confirmation of the pos just submitted
    possible responses:
        yes - update session state and elicit next slot value or output completed mad lib (if final slot)
        no - elicit the pos again
        not understood - try again
